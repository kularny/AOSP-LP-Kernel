To create a 'Synapse' supported ramdisk, please perform the following steps :-

1> Copy your 'ramdisk.cpio' file to some location & extract it.

2> Add all the files in the 'res' and 'sbin' directory to the corresponding directories that you have extracted from the 'ramdisk.cpio' file.

3> Add the lines in the 'init.rc' file to the very bottom of the 'init.rc' file of the ramdisk that you extracted from the 'ramdisk.cpio' file.

4> Now from within the same 'ramdisk' directory that you extracted from the 'ramdisk.cpio' file and added all the 'Synapse' modules, run the command 'find . -not -name ".gitignore" | cpio -o -H newc > /tmp/boot.cpio' without the quotes.

5> Traverse to the 'tmp' directory and cut/move the newly generated 'boot.cpio' file to the path in the kernel directory 'out/ramdisk/boot.cpio'.
