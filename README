#INLINE BUILDING ONLY

***Instructions on how to compile the kernel***

#How to compile the kernel
1> Only inline building is supported. Manual building of kernel won't work as the kernel is now modified to work completely inline.
2> Kernel must be built along with ROM.


#Manual Compilation
1> Copy the following lines to BoardConfig.mk in the i9100 device tree.

# Kernel Toolchain
KERNEL_TOOLCHAIN := $(ANDROID_BUILD_TOP)/kernel/samsung/smdk4412/toolchain/arm-cortex-a9/bin
KERNEL_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX := arm-eabi-

2> Now start building the kernel along with ROM in inline mode.
